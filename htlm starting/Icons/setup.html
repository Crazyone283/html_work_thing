        <p>I started from p5.js with my first game ever on java script "pong" if you are not familiar with pong game it was the most treanding game in 70s where a player has to not let the ai paddle score by not letting it goal. Then i continued with my second which was ballon buster in which you were supposed to shoot the balloons from given bow & arrow.
        after that i changed my editor from p5.j to code.org and started with a rip off of flappy bird which was a trully horrible mistake as i was not familiar with code.org its interface was pretty easy tho i stayed very less on that editor changing it to visual studio code trying to create another rip off of angry bird in which i succeed and that is it i am continuing with visual studio while making this portfolio thing stuff.</p>
